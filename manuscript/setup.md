# Create your working environment

## Summary

Before you can get started you need to have a stable working environment. While humanists are used to a working environment for most day to day writing, editing, and teaching work, the kind of working environment that one needs for doing digital work may be different from the kind of working environment you are used to.

## Goals
* Set up a bootable persistant usb device to serve as a working environment
* become familiar with the command line and instructions that involve working on the command line
* practice approaching the computer with no fear
* defamiliarize the notion of "computer"

## Why?
Most humanists are used to a working environment that is oriented towards a particular set of tasks: email, web browsing, document production through something like MS Word, and creating class presentations with Powerpoint or some similar tool. Most (but not all) humanists are therefore working primarily in a graphical interface and approach their own machines as graphical devices. Outside of writing, teaching, and the daily business of the academy, most (but not all) humanists might also use their devices for entertainment or for sharing photos or any of the other things that one requires a computer to do nowadays. 

We may not think of our graphical interfaces as a constrained environment, but in years of working with humanities graduate students and faculty I have come to think that the GUI is a limiting rather than an enabling factor for much work in digital humanities. It is the barrier which makes other kinds of computer work seem difficult or inaccessible and too often turns otherwise competent and confident humanists into novices clinging to a state of learned helplessness.

## Summary
In this chapter we build a working environment. While doing so, we will learn about how computers work and build skills necessary for working with the examples in later chapters.

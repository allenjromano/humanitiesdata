# Git and Version Control

## Summary

Git is a standard for version control of software especially, but version control is a concept readily applicable to most work that you will do in digital humanities. Technically speaking, a git database keeps track of changes to individual files, allowing multiple users (or members of a collaborative team) to independentally work on projects while having a mechanism to reconcile changes. There are multiple types of git workflow, but for our purposes here git provides a simple way to track, publish, and share your code and data. 

## Git: the What


## The How

There are multiple platforms for hosting your git repository, each with good guides to get started. All provide a free tier of service, usually with both private and public repositories, as well as more features (primarily for software develpoment teams) for a fee. You will likely only need to use the free account.

# Introduction

## What this book is about
This book is work in progress created to accompany the course Introduction to Digital Humanities 1: Humanities Data, taught by Allen J. Romano at Florida State University as part of the digital humanities graduate program in the Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities. Such a book serves multiple purposes: 
1. This book collects materials which are otherwise patchwork and spread out in a variety of sources and media. 
2. This book uses examples relevant to the concerns and problems humanists face in doing digital analysis of their data. Many how-to and guides assume that the default examples are in math or in basic statistics, areas which are often less familiar to humanists coming to this material from their home field of humanities. 
3. This book combines the how-to and pragmatic aspecs with the distinctively humanistic critical focus questioning terminology, category, and scope. While critical inquiry is always a part of any disciplines' mode of self-reflection, humanists frame such quesitoning in terms that are distinct from the concerns of, e.g. computer science engineers or data scientists. Put another way, while areas like data ethics may be of interest to many in technical disciplines, it takes different forms which approaches from experts in data and experts in ethics.

## Who this book is for
This book is aimed primarily at students and faculty in humanities disciplines, but is also of interest to students coming to data humanities from computing or information science. For humanists, the book collects together a wide range of materials, both practical and critical, to serve as a guided introduction and training in working with humanistic data. For those in other fields, this book includes data of the sort that humanists regularly deal with but which are not necessarily the stuff of wider study. It also brings together the technical and the critical.

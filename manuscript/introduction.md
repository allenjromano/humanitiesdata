# Introduction

## What this book is about
This book is work in progress created to accompany the course Introduction to Digital Humanities, taught by Allen J. Romano at Florida State University as part of the digital humanities graduate program in the Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities. Such a book serves multiple purposes: 

## Why this book is needed

This book fills three needs for digital humanities students. 
1. It speaks in terms of the digital and the humanities together and at the same time. While there are no shortages of tutorials on various methods relevant to the digital humanities, most of these are written for non-humanists. Even though such tutorials may be pitched at every level between beginner and expert, the scale of beginner to expert is one rooted in pre-existing knowledge or interest in computing. While many digital humanities students are eager to learn, it is often the case that they have been discouraged from thinking of themselves as "technical" people or have otherwise taken on assumptions about their own facility with computers which can make general purpose tutorials less fit to students needs. Many tutorials assume a default dataset rooted in mathematics or basic statistics, areas which are least familiar to many humanities students. Here the examples are real-world data from humanities and from projects in the digital humanities.

2. It collects materials which are otherwise patchwork and distributed in a variety of sources and media. There are excellent resources available online in, for example, [the programming historian](http://programminghistorian.com), class syllabi, or individual resources fn-[page needed]().  

3. It combines the how-to and pragmatic aspecs with the distinctively humanistic critical focus questioning terminology, category, and scope. While critical inquiry is always a part of any disciplines' mode of self-reflection, humanists frame such quesitoning in terms that are distinct from the concerns of, e.g. computer science engineers or data scientists. Put another way, while areas like data ethics may be of interest to many in technical disciplines, it takes different forms which approaches from experts in data and experts in ethics.

## Who this book is for
This book is aimed primarily at students and faculty in humanities disciplines, but is also of interest to students coming to data humanities from computing or information science. Because working with digital data in the humanities is often new territory for students and faculty alike, this book can be used with profit by undergraduate or graduate students, early career faculty or faculty seeking to integrate digital techniques into their repertoire. For humanists, the book collects together a wide range of materials, both practical and critical, to serve as a guided introduction and training in working with humanistic data. For those in other fields, this book includes data of the sort that humanists regularly deal with but which are not necessarily the stuff of wider study. It also brings together the technical and the critical.

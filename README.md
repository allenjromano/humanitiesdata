# Humanities Data

In progress: a coursebook in Digital Humanities

Materials in this repository are being actively developed and modified. A stable copy will eventually be available on leanpub.

Fall 2020: I am working on collating and collecting the various bits and pieces of writing that I have on these topics. The manuscript directory will look like a collection of scraps for a while. The document Book.txt is, for leanpub, the table of contents; I will update this periodically but it is not the primary focus right now.

Comments and constructive feedback are always welcome at aromano at fsu dot edu.
